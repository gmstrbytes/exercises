# Exercises

This repository stores material related to the exercises in _A Programmer's
Introduction to Mathematics_.

I haven't yet figured out exactly what the format of this repository will be.
If you're working on an exercise and you are stuck and would like to start a
discussion, please open an issue. Make sure to include the exercise number, and
[include a tag](https://github.com/pim-book/exercises/labels) corresponding to
the chapter.

If you believe there is a mistake in an exercise, you may also open an issue,
but please also submit an erratum through the link at
[pimbook.org](https://pimbook.org).
